The coin change problem is a classic computational problem in the field of computer science and algorithms. It involves finding the number of ways to make change for a given amount of money, using a given set of coin denominations. The goal is to determine the different combinations of coins that can be used to make up the target amount.

Here's a description of the coin change problem:

**Problem Statement:**

Given a set of coin denominations (e.g., [1, 5, 10, 25]) and a target amount (e.g., 30 cents), the coin change problem aims to find the number of unique ways to make change for the target amount using the provided coins.

**Example:**

Let's illustrate the problem with an example:

- Denominations: [1, 5, 10, 25] (representing 1 cent, 5 cents, 10 cents, and 25 cents)
- Target amount: 30 cents

The goal is to find the number of ways to make 30 cents using these coins. Possible combinations include:

1. Three 10-cent coins.
2. One 5-cent coin and five 1-cent coins.
3. One 5-cent coin, one 10-cent coin, and one 25-cent coin.

In this example, there are three unique ways to make change for 30 cents. The coin change problem seeks to compute this count.
